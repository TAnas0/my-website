                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I’m <strong>OWL: Over Worked Lark</strong>—a backend developer who thrives on building
                        scalable architectures and finding elegant solutions to complex problems. I’m a night owl at
                        heart, but like a lark, I rise early to tackle the day’s challenges. I believe in clean code,
                        efficient workflows, and keeping a sense of humor even when I’m "over worked." If you're looking
                        for a developer who can both code and make your day a little brighter, I'm your guy!</p>
                    <p>Feel free to check out my work, or <a href="#contact">book some time with me</a> to chat about
                        your next project.</p>

                        Every decision we make is guided by underlying processes. In this series, inspired by Algorithms
                        to
                        Live By by Brian Christian, we explore how algorithms shape our choices and actions. From
                        optimizing
                        time to navigating uncertainty, we’ll uncover the algorithms that can improve how we live, work,
                        and
                        solve problems—transforming complex decisions into actionable insights.

                    <p>
                        Everything has a beginning and an end. The journey in between is what defines life. In this
                        series, we explore the life cycles of software and systems—from birth to death. We’ll dive into
                        how these "creatures" are born, grow, travel, fulfill their purpose, and eventually fade. Let’s
                        uncover the unseen paths they take and the stories they tell.
